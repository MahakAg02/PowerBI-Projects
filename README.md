# **📊 E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard**
## Customer, Product, Revenue & Risk Insights | Power BI Project | DAX | Data Modeling

**🚀 Overview**
This project simulates a real-world e-commerce analytics scenario, where I played the role of a _Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks_ — a fictional multi-region online retailer. The goal was to transform raw, unstructured datasets into an automated dashboard that provides actionable insights into:
- Revenue and profit trends
- Product-level performance
- Customer segmentation and lifetime value
- Regional sales behavior
- Return rates and operational efficiency

**⚙️ Approach & Execution**\
**🛠️ Tools used**\
_Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Data Modeling | Excel_

- Data Extraction and Cleaning of raw, unstructured data using Power Query\
- Star schema data modeling with fact & dimension tables (Products, Customers, Regions, Orders)\
- Defined relationships, hierarchies, and formatting standards for scalable analysis\
- Built custom measures and calculated columns for- Revenue, profit, return rate, Monthly & YOY growth, Average order value (AOV), Customer lifetime value (LTV)\
- Designed an interactive dashboard with cards, KPIs, charts, slicers, maps & drilldowns\
 
**📊 Key Features**\
📈 Revenue & Profit KPIs- Monthly targets vs actuals\
👥 Customer Segmentation based on income, occupation, purchase frequency, return rates\
🛍️ Top Products Analysis by Sales, Returns and Profitability\
📦 Product-level risk flags based on return patterns to identify quality/churn risks\
🎯 Forecasting trends and early signs for performance dips in products\
🌍 Regional Insights via interactive map (NA, EU, Pacific)\


**💡 Business Impact:**\
✅ Identification of high-margin products and low-return SKUs for promotional targeting and prioritizing inventory\
✅ Discovery of high-LTV customer segments for loyalty initiatives\
✅ Insight into underperforming regions or product lines for resource reallocation\
✅ Reduction in returns through visibility into return-heavy products\
✅ Data-backed pricing & promotional decisions based on performance trends\
✅ Provided stakeholders with real-time KPIs and performance benchmarks to make data-driven decisions to improve pricing, promotion strategy, customer targeting, and inventory planning.

**📌 Recommendations**\
- Boost marketing spend on top-performing SKUs with high margins and low return rates\
- Monitor products with above-average return rate for churn or quality issues and reduce promotions\
- Prioritize retention strategies for high-LTV customer segments (identified by income & frequency) via tailored email campaigns\
- Reallocate stock to regions showing consistent month-over-month growth\
