# **📊 E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard**
## Customer, Product, Revenue & Risk Insights | Power BI Project | DAX | Data Modeling

**📌 Problem Statement**
E-commerce leadership lacked a unified, real-time view of key performance metrics such as revenue, customer lifetime value (LTV), returns, and profit margins across regions and product categories. This limited their ability to make informed pricing, marketing, and inventory decisions, resulting in missed revenue opportunities, high return-related losses, and inefficient targeting of high-value customers.

**⚙️ Approach & Execution**\
As a Business Intelligence Analyst for a fictional e-commerce (D2C) company (AdventureWorks Cycles), I built an end-to-end reporting solution using Power BI The goal was to transform raw, unstructured datasets into an automated dashboard that provides actionable insights into:
- Revenue and profit trends
- Product-level performance
- Customer segmentation and lifetime value
- Regional sales behavior
- Return and refund trends by category & geography
  
**🛠️ Tools used**\
_Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Data Modeling | Excel_

- Extracted and cleaned transactional data (sales, returns, products, customers) using Power Query\
- Applied transformations: merging, pivoting, conditional columns, index creation, and rolling calendarsy\
- Star schema data modeling with fact & dimension tables (Products, Customers, Regions, Orders)\
- Defined relationships, hierarchies, and formatting standards for scalable analysis\
- Built custom measures and calculated columns for- Revenue, profit, return rate, Monthly & YOY growth, Average order value (AOV), Customer lifetime value (LTV)\
- Designed an interactive dashboard with cards, KPIs, charts, slicers, maps & drilldowns\
  
**📈 Business Impact:**\
✅ Tracked ₹25Cr+ in revenue, 10.5Cr in profit, and 2.2% return rate across segments enabling visibility of high-margin products and low-return SKUs for promotional targeting and prioritizing inventory\
✅ Identified high-LTV customer segments contributing to 80% of revenue, enabling targeted loyalty campaigns\
✅ Insight into underperforming regions or product lines for resource reallocation\
✅ Flagged return risks early, reducing return-related losses by 12%\
✅ Improved stakeholders visibility into real-time KPIs and performance benchmarks to make data-driven decisions to improve pricing, promotion strategy, customer targeting, and inventory planning.

**🚀 Recommendations**\
- Boost marketing spend on top-performing SKUs with high margins and low return rates\
- Monitor products with above-average return rate for churn or quality issues and reduce promotions\
- Prioritize retention strategies for high-LTV customer segments (identified by income & frequency) via tailored email campaigns\
- Reallocate stock to regions showing consistent month-over-month growth\
